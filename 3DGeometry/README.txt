3DGeometry: Executable: Opens a new window that displays a rotating cube. The cube should rotate in a random direction until it's either rotated 90 degrees or bumped the edge of the window. If it's bumped the edge of the window it'll will inverse it's rotation and continue in that direction until it either hits another wall or finishes the 90 degrees (90 - degrees of rotation before hitting the wall). If it completes it's 90 degree rotation it randomly selects a new direction to rotate in.
CMakeLists.txt: Just a cmake file directing the compiler to my custom made matrix library
RotatingCube.cpp: Readable code of the 3DGeometry executable
